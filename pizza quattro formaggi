Recipe for quattro formaggi pizza. This is my favorite pizza of all time.

Ingredients
- pizza dough
- tomato sauce
- mozzarella, parmesan cheese, gorgonzola and blue cheese (or any of your favorite cheeses)
- truffle oil

Directions
- Preheat the oven to 180 degrees C
- Put the sauce and the toppings on the pizza. Note: don't put the cheeses too close to the edges or they might melt off.
- Put the pizza in the oven for about 12 minutes (time depends on your oven)
- Buon appetito!
